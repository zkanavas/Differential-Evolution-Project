There were a total of 81 iterations for this example. The maximum value reached was <strong> 9.99783 </strong> for the Euclidean distance during iteration #56. In the next iteration, #57, the value of the Euclidean distance weight was 5.40038228. </p> <p> When the mutation vector maxes out as it does here, the algorithm proceeds as normal, mutating the current best vector with two random vectors. The algorithm may retain that high weight value, but only if it results in a high fitness score - namely, a high accuracy. </p> </div></div><div class="row"><div class="col"><div class = "text-center"><figure class="figure"><img src="weights.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="..."><figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Figure 1.
